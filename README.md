## API Information

This app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve weather data. Make sure you have your own API key:

1. Register at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
2. Obtain your API key and replace it in the `API_KEY` variable in `app.py`.

## City Groupings

The app includes a unique feature where entering certain city combinations automatically adds related cities to the search:

For example:
- Entering `Kavala` and `Thessaloniki` together will also include `Ierissos`, `Stavros`, and `Thassos`.

To add more groupings, edit the `city_groupings` dictionary in `app.py`.

---

## Weather Alerts

A feature of this app is to display alerts based on weather conditions. The current setting provides warnings when:
- **Wind Speed**: If the wind speed is greater than 5 m/s, a warning will be displayed for that specific time period.

You can customize the alert threshold in the function `highlight_high_wind`.
